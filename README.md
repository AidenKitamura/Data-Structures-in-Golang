# Data-Structures-in-Golang
An exercise to implement classic data structures in golang. The code is written in a self-explaining manner. Due to the fact that generic hasn't been implemented in Golang yet, all the data structures implemented here are using integers as an example.
## Content
1. Dynamic Array
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Stack
4. Queue
5. Priority Queue
6. Union
7. Binary Search Tree
8. Hash Table
9. Fenwick Tree
10. Suffix Array
11. AVL Tree
12. Indexed Priority Queue
## Usage
The code is for reference only and not tested on production environment. The implementation might not be perfect, since they are for exercise only. Before using any of these code, it is strongly recommended that you change the package name and comment out the unnecessary Println lines.
